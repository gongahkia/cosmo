DIFFERENTIATION FROM EXISTING TOOLS
================================================================================

Cosmo's Unique Position:

vs. World Machine / World Creator (Commercial terrain tools):
  - Open source and free
  - Research-backed algorithms (not black boxes)
  - Educational transparency (see exactly how it works)
  - Lua scripting: easier to modify than C++
  - 2D top-down focus (strategic/gameplay view)

vs. Procedural Noise Libraries (libnoise, FastNoise):
  - Complete terrain generators, not just noise primitives
  - Scientific context: each generator tied to research
  - Ready-to-use: immediate visual output
  - Domain-specific: optimized for terrain, not generic noise

vs. Game Engine Terrain Tools (Unity Terrain, Unreal Landscape):
  - Standalone: use with any engine or no engine
  - Research focus: learn principles, not just results
  - Faster iteration: lightweight tool vs heavy engine
  - Complementary: generate in Cosmo, refine in engine

Cosmo's Niche:
  "The scientifically-rigorous, educational, open-source terrain generation
   tool that bridges academic research and production game development."

================================================================================
END OF STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

Total New Suggestions: 60+ strategic initiatives
Overlap with existing todo.txt: Minimal (intentionally complementary)
Estimated Total Work: 3-5 years for full implementation
Community Contribution Potential: High (40% of suggestions suitable for external contributors)

Next Steps:
1. Review and prioritize based on team capacity
2. Create GitHub project board for tracking
3. Publish roadmap for community input
4. Identify quick wins for momentum (Phase 1 items)
5. Establish partnerships (universities, game studios) for validation

Remember: Quality over quantity. Better to excel at 10 things than be mediocre
at 100. Choose features that maximize impact for practitioners while maintaining
the scientific integrity that makes Cosmo unique.
